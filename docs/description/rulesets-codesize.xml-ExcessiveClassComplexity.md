Tracks the complexity of classes by summing method complexities. Refactor classes exceeding a Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 50 to improve maintainability. For example, break down large classes with many responsibilities.

```java
// Issue
class LargeClass {
  void method1() { /* complex code */ }
  void method2() { /* complex code */ }
  // Numerous complex methods
}

// Solution
class SmallerClass1 {
  void method1() { /* less complex code */ }
}

class SmallerClass2 {
  void method2() { /* less complex code */ }
}
```
