Classes with excessive fields are difficult to manage. Refactor these classes by grouping related fields into well-defined smaller classes. For example, replace separate `zip`, `city`, and `country` fields with an `Address` class. This improves code readability and maintainability. 

Example:
```java
// Issue: Too many fields
class Person {
    String name;
    String zip;
    String city;
    String country;
}

// Solution: Using a dedicated Address class
class Person {
    String name;
    Address address;
}

class Address {
    String zip;
    String city;
    String country;
}
```
