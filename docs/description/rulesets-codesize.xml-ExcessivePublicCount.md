Classes with many public members are harder to test and maintain. Consider refactoring to smaller, focused classes to improve modularity. Example of issue:
```php
class LargeClass {
    public $data1; public $data2; // too many attributes
    public function method1() {} // too many methods
}
class ExtractedClass {
    private $data1; // limited and focused attributes
    public function method1() {} // encapsulated and focused methods
}
```
