Cyclomatic Complexity quantifies the number of decision points in a method. Keeping this number low improves maintainability. Refactor methods with high complexity to simplify them.

```php
// High Complexity Example
function example() {
    if (cond1) {
        //...
    } else if (cond2) {
        //...
    }
}
```

Refactoring can reduce complexity.
