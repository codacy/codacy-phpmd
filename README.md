# Codacy PHPMD

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [PHPMD](http://phpmd.org/) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
See the [codacy-engine-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed) repository for more information.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```
docker build -t codacy-phpmd-base .
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
```

## Update Documentation

The documentation is updated manually by checking the official documentation rules in the [PHPMD repository](https://github.com/phpmd/phpmd).

## Update version

1. Install php:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php (it will create the composer.phar file)
```
2. Update phpmd version on composer.json:

```
"require": {
        "phpmd/phpmd": "x.xx.x"
    }
```

3. Run the update command to get the latest versions of the dependencies and to update the composer.lock file:

```
php composer.phar update
```

Note: If you receive a message like this:

```
Could not fetch <URL package>, please review your configured GitHub OAuth token or enter a new one to access private repos" Create a new token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=&description=Composer to retrieve a token.
```

create the token and paste it to proceed.

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
